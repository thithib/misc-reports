# Miscellaneous Reports

Here are some reports written as part of school projects or other stuff.

### Spamalysis

Please see the dedicated repository [here](https://github.com/thithib/spamalysis).

### EARL

EARL (Experimental Anti-Rootkit LSM) was a Linux Security Module developed as part of a student project ([Telecom SudParis](http://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en_accueil.html)). It aimed at providing means to detect rootkits activities on the system. The prototype itself is not very advanced but the report (written in French, sorry for that) can hopefully give the reader a good introduction to rootkits targeting Linux. This project was accomplished with [Yassine Tioual](https://github.com/nisay759).

The PDF file is named `earl.pdf`.

### Bibliographic Review: Protection Provided by Operating System-level Virtualization

This document is a bibliographic review focused on protection provided by operating system-level virtualization (i.e. containers) and was accomplished with [Yassine Tioual](https://github.com/nisay759). Sorry for the ugly bibliography at the end, we did not know bibtex at the time...

The PDF file is named `bibliographic-review-protection-provided-by-operating-system-level-virtualization.pdf`.

### Implementation of a Moving Target Defense Framework to Defend Against Isolation Violations in IaaS Infrastructures

This report is confidential for now and will be available in January 2018. It was written at the end of my 6-months internship at Orange Labs.

During this internship, I was part of a research team working on Cloud security. I implemented a "Moving Target Defense" framework to detect cache-based side-channel attacks between virtual machines in order to mitigate them.
